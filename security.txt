1. Comprehensive Threat Prevention Matrix

Threat/Attack Type
High-Security Mitigation Strategy
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
DOM sanitization, CSP headers, output encoding
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, origin checks
NoSQL Injection
Mongoose validation, parameterized queries, strict schema enforcement
Brute Force
Login rate limiting, IP lockouts, CAPTCHA integration
DoS/DDoS
API Gateway throttling, AWS WAF, rate limits per IP
JWT Theft / Replay Attacks
Short-lived tokens, refresh tokens, Redis-based revocation, IP fingerprinting
Session Hijacking
HttpOnly and Secure cookies, user-agent verification
Clickjacking
X-Frame-Options headers, CSP frame restrictions
Path Traversal
File path validation, sandboxed storage directories
Insecure Deserialization
JSON-only APIs, strict input validation, no eval/exec
MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)
TLS 1.3, HSTS headers, secure cookie flags
Open Redirects
Allowlist of redirect URLs, URI format checks
Business Logic Abuse
Invariant checks at the controller level, audit logs
Privilege Escalation
Role-based checks at each endpoint, separation of duties
File Upload Exploits
MIME/type validation, virus scanning, isolated storage buckets
Sensitive Data Exposure
Field-level encryption, TLS-only communication, data minimization
Replay Attacks
Use of nonces, timestamps, and idempotency keys
SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery)
No external fetch from user input, allowlisted URLs only
Insecure APIs
Endpoint authentication, method restrictions, parameter-level validations
Misconfigured CORS
Exact origin matching, disallowing wildcard origins when credentials are used
Broken Access Control
RBAC + ABAC enforcement, ownership checks on resources
Code Injection
Avoid use of eval, dynamic string execution, sanitize CLI or command payloads
Credential Stuffing
Rate-limiting, IP blacklisting, MFA, breached-password detection integration
Directory Listing
Server-side directory listing disabled, file access via signed URLs
